# P802MA-MKS-base-v1.5-marlin
Marlin 1.1.x firmware for the MKS Base V1.5 on an Anet A8/Tronxy P802MA (AUTO LEVELING)

I modded the a fresh copy of Marlin 1.1.x to enable autoleveling on my P802MA variant of the Anet A8. 
Use Arduino 1.8.2 to upload firmware through the blue USB cord to your MKS Base 1.5
